ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm currently a Grad Student at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/cs/). I completed my undergrad at [Manipal Institute of Technology, India](https://manipal.edu/mit.html), and had developed a keen interest in all things ML during my first year and was fortunate to gain research experience along the way. Prior to joining BU, I worked with the Content and User Understanding team at ShareChat, and was fortunate to work on projects with the Serre Lab (Brown University), Human Dynamics Group (MIT Media Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology), ETS, Montreal and FOR.ai (now Cohere for AI).

At BU, I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Deepti Ghadiyaram](https://deeptigp.github.io), and Iâ€™m currently exploring topics in computer vision, with a broad interest in representation learning and generative models.
